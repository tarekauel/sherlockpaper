\section{Summary}
The goal of the course project was to develop a new dynamic analysis tool for finding opportunities for early property initialization in order to improve the performance and the readability of JavaScript code. While there is still a long way to go to find all opportunities, our results show that Sherlock is able to cover a broad range of cases which can be optimized. We also give some ideas for future iterations of Sherlock to handle do - while loops. Our tool is able to automatically generate proposals for early property initialization and keep the number of false positive as low as possible in the same time. This is really important for the usability of such a dynamic analysis tool.\\ Our results show that the goal to improve the readability of the code can be achieved by Sherlock, but there is no improvement in the performance. This may be due the fact that we used a very old version of nodejs because Jalangi has some incompability issues with newer versions.
